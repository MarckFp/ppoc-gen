		"faq-difference": "What's the difference between a turn and a schedule?",
		"faq-difference-answer": "For our point of view, a schedule is how often you preach with the exhibitors on a specific place (ie: every Monday at 12:00am at X place). In the other hand a turn is the exact day when that schedule happens (ie: Monday 3 of June at 12:00 at X place)",
